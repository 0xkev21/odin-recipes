    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Chicken enchiladas are a delicious Mexican-inspired dish made with tender, seasoned chicken, wrapped in tortillas, and smothered in a flavorful enchilada sauce.
        The chicken is typically cooked with spices, such as cumin and chili powder, then shredded and rolled into corn tortillas.
        These enchiladas are placed in a baking dish, topped with more sauce and cheese, and baked until bubbly and golden.
        They are often garnished with toppings like sour cream, chopped cilantro, and sliced jalapeños for added flavor.
        Chicken enchiladas are a comforting and satisfying meal that's perfect for family dinners or gatherings with friends.
